Hey, I’m @ingridvulpix!

I’m interested in programing, video games and cats.

I’m currently learning Python, SQL and C++.

I’m looking to collaborate on exciting projects and I'm working on the development of a visual novel (I'm also always updating with some info about the programming and logic courses I'm attending).

You can reach me from my LinkedIn profile ( https://www.linkedin.com/in/ingrid-de-almeida-78bab91b3/ )


Have a nice day!
